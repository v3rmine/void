# Dedale **(!! WORK IN PROGRESS, FAR FROM READY !!)**
**Goal:** Fly.io compatible service but self hosted (*Note: if you have money go fly.io it'll be better*)  

> Why this project? 
> I have too much small services to host and experiments with that'll cost too much if hosted on fly, so this was born. 
> And I want to keep as small friction as possible, so that I can easily migrate to fly if needed.

## In scope (not ordered)
> **Note:** All these might change, so don't take it as granted

- [ ] Scale services between 0 and 1
