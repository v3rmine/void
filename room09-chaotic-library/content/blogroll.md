This blog feels quite empty no?   
Check some cool websites with more cool content:

- <https://bouvier.cc/> (en/fr) he talks about tech and his life, I think his notes are what gave me the urge to revive my blog, not necessarily with professional quality, but to leave a trace and share what I do
- <https://jvns.ca/> (en) she writes about tech content and a lot of her posts/zines are beginner friendly so yeah a really good blog to have in your RSS feed
- <https://val.packett.cool/> (en) she's not a prolific tech blogger, but I still enjoy her posts and she's doing awesome work with her projects!
