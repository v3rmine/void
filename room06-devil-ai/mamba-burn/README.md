# mamba-burn
A simple implementation of Mamba, to learn and understand the architecture (and also try out [tracel-ai/burn](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn)).

**Not intended for production.**

## Roadmap (will be updated and will change)
### Phase 1: Foundations
- [x] Project setup and dependencies
- [ ] Basic model configuration
- [ ] Embedding and projection structure
- [ ] SimpleBlock implementation
- [ ] Simplified 1D convolution
- [ ] Basic dataloader
- [ ] Unit tests

<!--
### Phase 2: Basic SSM
- [ ] Linear SSM implementation
- [ ] Forward & backward passes
- [ ] Standard recursive scan
- [ ] SSM discretization
- [ ] Testing with simple sequences

### Phase 3: Selective Mamba
- [ ] Input-dependent parameterization (selectivity)
- [ ] B and C parameter projection
- [ ] S6 Block implementation
- [ ] Integration of convolution with SSM
- [ ] Multi-layer structure

### Phase 4: Optimizations
- [ ] Parallel scan algorithm
- [ ] Memory optimizations
- [ ] Gradient checkpointing
- [ ] Benchmarking
- [ ] Profiling and critical optimizations

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- [ ] Attention mask support
- [ ] KV-caching for inference
- [ ] Autoregressive generation
- [ ] Streaming inference

### Phase 6: Finalization
- [ ] Conversion from PyTorch checkpoints
- [ ] Serialization/deserialization
- [ ] Complete documentation
- [ ] Usage examples
- [ ] Comparative benchmarks
