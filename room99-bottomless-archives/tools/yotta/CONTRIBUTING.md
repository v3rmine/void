request](https://github.com/armmbed/yotta/pulls), and [bug
reports](https://github.com/armmbed/yotta/issues) are welcome!

If you're looking for somewhere to get started helping out with yotta
development, then have a look at the
[up-for-grabs](https://github.com/armmbed/yotta/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aup-for-grabs)
issues. All of these should be relatively straightforward to implement or fix,
without modifying a large amout of existing code. If you have any questions,
feel free to comment on the corresponding issue!
